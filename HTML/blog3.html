                Work-Life Balance happens in every field and the tech field is
                not an easy one. There's a lot of time where i will have no idea
                how much time has passed while still having more work to do...So
                Work-Life Balance shakes and Time management is a very important
                skill and even the best of the bests still struggles with their
                work and lifestyles....However, I believe a balance can be
                created and try to be maintained...it could just take a bit of
                work! br However, there are still some of us that may have no
                issue with our Work-Life balance from the scratch as they have
                always had one built on every thing they do.
