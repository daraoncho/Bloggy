            <h3 class="cat-topic">My journey in tech</h3>
            <p class="blog-desc">
              I have always have passion about working in tech and creating
              iconic and cool things when i was younger and in High
              school...However, I didn't really get into the tech industry till
              2022 during the big ASUU strike... <br />
              <br />
              I found myself at home and with a lot of free time and I actually
              wanted to do something productive or anything at all during that
              time...To be honest...Programming and coding isn't the first thing
              on my mind...matter of fact, It didn't pop into my mind. <br />
              <br />
              While I was trying to find something to do, My Godmother/Mentor
              got me interview with <b>Cloudware Technologies</b> where I later
              got a software development intern job and this is where my actual
              journey began. <br />
              During the time, I didn't really know about programming or much
              about coding really; however I really did have interest in it. I
              got into Web development although I had more eyes for AI and game
              development...however, every journey start with a small step and
              start easy and go hard!(I don't know if that makes senseüòÇ...I
              just said it right off the batüòÇüíî) <br />
              <br />
              I met a lot of great people and colleagues and got to work it them
              and it was really beautiful! But school came calling back and I
              had to go back. During the holidays, I intend coming to the office
              and while I'm in school, I can work remotely if needed.

            <p class="blog-desc">
              I don't know but it just don't really work much for me; "Listening
              to songs while studying especially READING"...maybe I can do
              studying but when reading songs tends to distract me as I wouldn't
              understand as much as a calm space. <br />
              So when people read while blasting loud jams...I just feel envy
              for them lol like how do you guys do it?!...If I want to listen to
              songs while studying, I would prefer a song without lyrics(music)
              Which is why I love <i>lofi songs</i>. They keep you concentrated
              and focused on your task and does not distract much. I sometimes
              listen to lofi playlist on my phone or use YouTube and they have a
              nice website also <b>@lofi.co</b>. I think there's an other
              website called <b>@brain.fm</b>...I've heard review about it is
              being also really nice but I haven't tried it yet. <br />
              So yeah... that's my take on blasting jams while reading based on
              me I don't know if it's just me or there's more people like that
              out there.

            <p class="blog-desc">
              Work-Life Balance happens in every field and the tech field is not
              an easy one. There's a lot of time where i will have no idea how
              much time has passed while still having more work to do...So
              Work-Life Balance shakes and Time management is a very important
              skill and even the best of the bests still struggles with their
              work and lifestyles....However, I believe a balance can be created
              and try to be maintained...it could just take a bit of work! br
              However, there are still some of us that may have no issue with
              our Work-Life balance from the scratch as they have always had one
              built on every thing they do.
