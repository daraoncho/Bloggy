                I have always have passion about working in tech and creating
                iconic and cool things when i was younger and in High
                school...However, I didn't really get into the tech industry
                till 2022 during the big ASUU strike... <br />
                <br />
                I found myself at home and with a lot of free time and I
                actually wanted to do something productive or anything at all
                during that time...To be honest...Programming and coding isn't
                the first thing on my mind...matter of fact, It didn't pop into
                my mind. <br />
                <br />
                While I was trying to find something to do, My Godmother/Mentor
                got me interview with <b>Cloudware Technologies</b> where I
                later got a software development intern job and this is where my
                actual journey began. <br />
                During the time, I didn't really know about programming or much
                about coding really; however I really did have interest in it. I
                got into Web development although I had more eyes for AI and
                game development...however, every journey start with a small
                step and start easy and go hard!(I don't know if that makes
                senseüòÇ...I just said it right off the batüòÇüíî) <br />
                <br />
                I met a lot of great people and colleagues and got to work it
                them and it was really beautiful! But school came calling back
                and I had to go back. During the holidays, I intend coming to
                the office and while I'm in school, I can work remotely if
                needed.

                    The <b>Academic Staff Union of Universities</b> (ASUU) is a
                    Nigerian union of university academic staff, founded in
                    1978. The 2022 ASUU strike was actually the second longest
                    strike since the first in 1999.
