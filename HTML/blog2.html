                I don't know but it just don't really work much for me;
                "Listening to songs while studying especially READING"...maybe I
                can do studying but when reading songs tends to distract me as I
                wouldn't understand as much as a calm space. <br />
                So when people read while blasting loud jams...I just feel envy
                for them lol like how do you guys do it?!...If I want to listen
                to songs while studying, I would prefer a song without
                lyrics(music) Which is why I love <i>lofi songs</i>. They keep
                you concentrated and focused on your task and does not distract
                much. I sometimes listen to lofi playlist on my phone or use
                YouTube and they have a nice website also <b>@lofi.co</b>. I
                think there's an other website called <b>@brain.fm</b>...I've
                heard review about it is being also really nice but I haven't
                tried it yet. <br />
                So yeah... that's my take on blasting jams while reading based
                on me I don't know if it's just me or there's more people like
                that out there.

                    Music is composed of sounds together in a way that produces
                    an aesthetic experience. A song has lyrics that are meant to
                    be sung with our voice.
